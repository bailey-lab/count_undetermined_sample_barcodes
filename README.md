# Count Undetermined Sample Barcodes

Given an 'Undetermined' fastq file, an optional sample sheet (relating sample
names to barcode numbers) and an optional barcode labeling file (relating
barcode numbers to barcode sequences), this program tells the user how many
barcodes of each type were present, and (if user provides sample sheet and
barcode labeling file) tells the user what barcodes and what samples the
undetermined barcodes might map to.
