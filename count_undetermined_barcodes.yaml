#name given to R1 files - R1 and R2 have identical barcode composition, so only
#R1 is analyzed. Most sequencers specify R1 and R2 with _R1_ and _R2_, but this
#variable is in case the sequencer uses _1_ and _2_ or some other string to
#differentiate between R1 and R2.
R1: R1

#part coming after the read and sample, e.g. for
#Undetermined_S0_R1_001.fastq.gz, 001.fastq.gz would be the suffix
suffix: 001.fastq.gz
